      <h1>About FoodConnect</h1>
      <p>Tackling food waste at events, one plate at a time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-content">
      <p>Every year in Singapore, food waste remains one of the largest contributors to environmental impact, with over <strong>813,000 tonnes</strong> wasted in 2022 alone. Much of this comes from large-scale catered events where organisers over-order to prevent food shortages.</p>

      <p><strong>FoodConnect</strong> is a community-driven solution designed to bridge this gap. Our platform helps <strong>event organisers</strong> like corporate planners, wedding coordinators, and community managers quickly and easily share surplus food with nearby individuals who can make use of it.</p>

      <p>At the end of an event, food providers simply upload a description, image, and location of available food. Our system uses <strong>geolocation technology</strong> to connect this surplus with users in the area who can opt to pick it up‚Äîreducing waste and benefiting the community.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>üìç Events often end with excess food due to over-catering.</li>
        <li>‚ôªÔ∏è Redistribution opportunities are limited by time and reach.</li>
        <li>üåè Minimising food waste helps combat climate change and supports food security.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This project aligns with Singapore‚Äôs broader vision for sustainability, supported by initiatives like the NEA‚Äôs push for improved recycling and waste reduction. In 2022, recycling rates improved from 55% to 57%‚Äîbut we believe food rescue must also be a priority.</p>

      <p>By empowering communities to act in real time, FoodConnect is proud to be part of the movement toward a <strong>zero-waste future</strong>.</p>
