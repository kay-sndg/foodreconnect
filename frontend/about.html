          <h3>The Problem We're Solving</h3>
          <p>Food waste is a significant issue in Singapore, with 813,000 tonnes wasted in 2022 alone. Event organizers often over-order food to ensure guest satisfaction, resulting in substantial leftovers with no efficient way to redistribute them.</p>
          <p>We identified that event organizers – whether they're planning corporate functions, weddings, or community gatherings – face a common challenge: what to do with excess food at the end of their events, especially when they're in unfamiliar areas.</p>
          <h3>Our Solution</h3>
          <p>FoodConnect bridges this gap by providing a platform that connects event organizers with nearby users who can benefit from surplus food. Organizers can post details and photos of leftover items, while users can view and claim food in their area.</p>
          <p>Our platform uses geolocation to match surplus food with recipients nearby, ensuring efficient redistribution. It’s a win-win: less food waste, more people helped.</p>
